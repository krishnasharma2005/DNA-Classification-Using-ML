# ðŸ§¬ DNA Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning** to classify DNA promoter sequences. Promoter recognition is critical in genetics for understanding gene regulation and predicting diseases.
With the growing volume of genetic data, manual classification is no longer feasible. Our approach applies supervised learning algorithms to automate the classification of DNA sequences.

## Key Objectives

1. Preprocess raw DNA promoter sequences into a machine-readable format.  
2. Train and compare multiple ML models for classification.  
3. Evaluate model performance using accuracy and visualization.  
4. Provide a lightweight, reproducible pipeline for bioinformatics tasks.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Promoter+Gene+Sequences)
- **Type**: DNA promoter sequences  
- **Classes**: Promoter (+1) / Non-promoter (-1)  
- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding of nucleotides (A, T, G, C) â†’ 228 features per sequence

---

## Preprocessing Pipeline

1. Load DNA sequence dataset (.data format)
2. Convert sequences to individual nucleotides
3. One-hot encode each nucleotide:
   - A â†’ [1, 0, 0, 0]  
   - T â†’ [0, 1, 0, 0]  
   - G â†’ [0, 0, 1, 0]  
   - C â†’ [0, 0, 0, 1]
4. Label encoding: +1 â†’ 1, -1 â†’ 0
